Notes:
	Testing is done at the bottom of the files.
	Tests throw `Test succeeded with choicepoint` warnings because there are
		multiple possible answers and I only check one per statement.
	`family.pl` includes a family tree made in ASCII for quick reference.

Files:
	family.pl - Question 1
  movies.pl - Question 2
  lists.pl  - Question 3, 4, 5
	testing.txt - Evidence code was tested
	readme.txt

Instructions:
	Run using SWI-Prolog version 7.6.3
	To run tests, load the program and execute run_tests().
